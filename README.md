# TravelPerk front-end assessment
## HTML5
-I have chosen to generate a responsive design from the start, that's why the whole page is based on the flexboxes available in CSS3.
-Although in figma's design only two screen resolutions were specified (1440px and 360px width, respectively), in order to achieve a better fluidity in the responsive experience, it has been chosen to establish 1200px as the turning point between web and mobile design.
-The structural tags of HTML5 have been used: header for the logo, footer for the page footer and section for the rest.
-Images in svg format have been prioritized in order to maintain resolution when resizing the page and to improve page loading speed.
-I'm aware that the client companies section is not as requested in the design. Due to time constraints I preferred to leave it like that so that the corrector could see the progress and my attempt to make the table fully responsive. I missed the detail of aligning the big element with the small ones and aligning the logos in the center of their container. The full responsive quality does work.
-CamelCase has been used for the definition of variables.


## CSS
-The SCSS global variable definition tool has been used to speed up the development process.
-The SCSS function definition tool has been used to speed up the development process.
-SCSS nesting function has been used.
-Styles have been defined for the web version and the mobile version.

## JS
-Simple pure JS that makes an asynchronous call to the defined API and performs data processing.
-If the call returns the data, it is dynamically injected into the HTML.
